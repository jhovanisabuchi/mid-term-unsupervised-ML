* Key Drivers of Clustering: Based on the K-means and hierarchical clustering, it was observed that product categories such as 'Fresh', 'Grocery', and 'Milk' are strong indicators of customer behavior, with similar product categories being clustered together. This suggests that these features play a significant role in customer segmentation.

* Correlation Insights: The EDA revealed a high correlation between 'Grocery' and 'Detergents_Paper' (e.g., correlation coefficient > 0.9), suggesting that customers who purchase grocery items are also likely to purchase detergents and paper products. This relationship can be used for targeted marketing strategies.

* Outlier Detection: Outliers were identified in certain product categories (such as 'Fresh' and 'Frozen'), indicating potential anomalies or unusual purchasing patterns. These outliers may represent unique customer segments or data errors that require further investigation and potential data cleaning.

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Results:The first three principal components captured a significant portion of the variance in the dataset. Component 1 primarily reflects a combination of 'Milk', 'Grocery', and 'Detergents_Paper', with 'Milk' and 'Grocery' contributing strongly to it. Component 2 is most influenced by 'Frozen' and 'Delicassen', while Component 3 is mainly driven by 'Fresh' and 'Frozen'. The values of the first three components indicate that product categories such as 'Milk' and 'Frozen' are pivotal in differentiating customer behavior, and this dimensionality reduction reduces the complexity of the data while retaining important feature relationships for further analysis.
